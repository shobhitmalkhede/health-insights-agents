Here is an example README.md file for the health-insights-agents repository. This README will explain the purpose of the project, how to use the code, and the expected input/output for each agent.
Health Insights Agents

This repository contains three specialized AI agents for processing health data and generating actionable insights. The agents include:

    Fitness Tracking Agent: Analyzes activity data (steps, calories burned, active minutes) and provides workout suggestions.
    Sleep Analysis Agent: Processes sleep data (duration, disturbances) and provides sleep improvement suggestions.
    Journaling Sentiment Analysis Agent: Analyzes journal entries to extract emotional tone (positive, negative, neutral) and provide emotional feedback.

The repository also contains an Insights Aggregation Layer that combines insights from all three agents to provide holistic recommendations.

Introduction

The health-insights-agents project simulates a system for analyzing physical and mental well-being using data from wearable devices and journal entries. The agents work independently, and the Insights Aggregation Layer combines their feedback to provide comprehensive health recommendations.
Installation

    Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/health-insights-agents.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd health-insights-agents

Install the required dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    To run each agent, use the provided Python scripts. Each agent takes specific input data and outputs a recommendation.

    You can run the Fitness Tracking Agent, Sleep Analysis Agent, and Journaling Sentiment Analysis Agent independently or use the Insights Aggregation Layer to combine their outputs.

Running the Fitness Tracking Agent

Run the script fitness_tracking_agent.py to analyze activity data:

python fitness_tracking_agent.py

Running the Sleep Analysis Agent

Run the script sleep_analysis_agent.py to analyze sleep data:

python sleep_analysis_agent.py

Running the Journaling Sentiment Analysis Agent

Run the script journaling_sentiment_analysis_agent.py to analyze journal entries:

python journaling_sentiment_analysis_agent.py

Running the Insights Aggregation Layer

Run the script insights_aggregation_layer.py to combine the feedback from all agents:

python insights_aggregation_layer.py

Agents
Fitness Tracking Agent

The Fitness Tracking Agent analyzes activity data such as steps, calories burned, and active minutes to provide recommendations for improving cardiovascular health.

Example Output:

{
  "user_id": "12345",
  "date": "2024-11-22",
  "steps": 8500,
  "calories_burned": 280,
  "active_minutes": 25,
  "suggestion": "Increase your daily steps by 10% to improve cardiovascular health."
}

Sleep Analysis Agent

The Sleep Analysis Agent processes sleep data (duration, disturbances) and provides recommendations to improve sleep quality.

Example Output:

{
  "user_id": "12345",
  "date": "2024-11-22",
  "sleep_hours": 5.5,
  "suggestion": "Your average sleep time has dropped below 6 hours. Consider a consistent bedtime routine."
}

Journaling Sentiment Analysis Agent

The Journaling Sentiment Analysis Agent analyzes journal entries for emotional tone (positive, neutral, negative) and provides feedback on emotional well-being.

Example Output:

{
  "user_id": "12345",
  "journal_entries": [
    {
      "date": "2024-11-22",
      "entry": "I feel really anxious about the upcoming presentation. It's overwhelming.",
      "sentiment": "Negative"
    },
    {
      "date": "2024-11-21",
      "entry": "Had a great day today! Felt accomplished after finishing all my tasks.",
      "sentiment": "Positive"
    }
  ]
}

Insights Aggregation

The Insights Aggregation Layer combines the feedback from all three agents and generates holistic recommendations for the user. For example:

Combined Insights Example:

{
  "user_id": "12345",
  "combined_feedback": [
    "Increase your daily steps by 10% to improve cardiovascular health.",
    "Your sleep is below the recommended 7 hours. Consider improving your bedtime routine.",
    "Your journal entries reflect stress. Try stress management techniques.",
    "Poor sleep and stress may affect your overall well-being. Consider practicing mindfulness or relaxation techniques."
  ]
}
